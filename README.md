# FortuneGAN
## The Data
Using a mildly reformated version of the list of 'fortunes' made available through [ruanyf/fortunes](https://github.com/ruanyf/fortunes/blob/master/data/fortunes) we cleaned and constructed a csv found in the *data* folder. This makes the text easier to load and more organized for learning language models, and such.

The code for the extraction of the fortune from the text file is found in the [fortune_cleaner.py](fortune_cleaner.py)
